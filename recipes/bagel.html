    Make bagels: Combine water, flour, sugar, salt, vegetable oil, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with
    the dough hook. Mix on low speed until dough is well-developed, about 8 minutes. To ensure the gluten has developed
    fully, cut off a walnut-sized piece of dough. Flour your fingers, and then stretch the dough: if it tears
    immediately, the dough needs more kneading. Fully developed dough should form a thin translucent "windowpane."

        Make bagels: Combine water, flour, sugar, salt, vegetable oil, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted
        with the dough hook. Mix on low speed until dough is well-developed, about 8 minutes. To ensure the gluten has
        developed fully, cut off a walnut-sized piece of dough. Flour your fingers, and then stretch the dough: if it
        tears immediately, the dough needs more kneading. Fully developed dough should form a thin translucent
        "windowpane."
    </li>
    <li>
        Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel, and let rise for 2
        hours.
    </li>
    <li>
        Punch dough down, place it on a lightly floured work surface, and use a knife or dough scraper to divide the
        dough into 6 pieces (or more, for smaller bagels). Roll each piece of dough into a sausage shape about 6 inches
        long. Join the ends to form a circle. Repeat with the remaining dough, and let the bagels rest for 15 minutes
    </li>

        Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange small
        plates with poppy seeds, sesame seeds, and onion flakes next to the baking sheet.

    <li>
        Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add honey, if desired (see Editor's Note). Boil three bagels
        at a time, until they rise to the surface of the pot, about 1 minute per side. Remove bagels with a slotted
        spoon and place them on the lined baking sheet.
    </li>
    <li>
        Dip the tops of the wet bagels into the toppings and arrange them, seed-side up, on the baking sheet. Sprinkle
        with coarse salt, if desired.
    </li>
    <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the bagels begin to brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
